# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# TODO-List-
# TO DO

ReactJS and tailwind CSS

To download React js :

npm create vite@latest

Y to proceed 

select “Javascript”

type “npm install”

Delete the app.css file and clear the content of index.css, app.jxs file 

in App.jsx : rafce 

Delete react.svg inside the assets folder 

I then installed tailwind CSS and followed the steps in the documentation 

and also install the extension.

use npm run dev 

while using the tailwind class, 

     <div className='flex items-center my-7'> in this, it would mean that the margin is 7, on y axis. so if it was mx it would be x axis. 

h-14 pl-36 

This would mean height 14 and padding from the left side. 

Created another jsx file where i typed rafce 

useRef() 

function is also from the reach package.
